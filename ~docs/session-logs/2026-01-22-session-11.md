## Work Completed

### 1. Release Analysis

Analyzed all epics and current feature completion:

| Epic | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| #1 Foundation | ✅ 100% | All infrastructure complete |
| #2 DAT Providers | 🟡 30% | Manual import works, auto-sync deferred |

| #6 Web UI | ✅ 100% | All pages functional |
| #9 Backend Rebuild | ✅ 100% | Modern architecture |
| #10 System Tray | 🟡 60% | Tray app works |
| #11 Legacy Cleanup | ✅ 100% | Clean codebase |
| #12 Base Features | ✅ 100% | All tests passing |

### 2. Created Release Plan

New document: `~docs/plans/release-1.0.0-plan.md`

Contents:
- Executive summary
- MVP feature matrix (40+ features analyzed)
- Blocker identification
- Test coverage requirements (332 → 350 target)
- Release checklist
- 4-week timeline
- Success criteria
- Risk assessment
- Feature parity comparison vs RomVault/ClrMame Pro

### 3. Created Epic #13 for Release 1.0.0

Added to `~docs/issues/epics.md`:
- Sub-Epic #13.1: Critical Fixes (4 issues)
- Sub-Epic #13.2: Documentation (4 issues)
- Sub-Epic #13.3: Testing & QA (4 issues)
- Sub-Epic #13.4: Release Artifacts (4 issues)

Total: 16 new issues for release preparation

### 4. Key Findings

**Ready for 1.0.0:**
- All core parsing (Logiqx XML, ClrMamePro)
- DAT import/export
- File scanning with resume
- Hash computation (CRC, MD5, SHA1)
- Header detection
- ROM verification
- Duplicate/bad dump detection
- 1G1R filtering
- Organization with templates
- Web UI with all pages
- SignalR real-time updates
- System tray application
- Windows service

**Blockers Identified:**
1. No /error endpoint handler (LOW - easy fix)
2. Missing CHANGELOG.md (MEDIUM - needs creation)
3. README needs installation guide (MEDIUM)

**Deferred to Post-1.0.0:**
- DAT auto-sync from providers (auth complexity)
- Memory-mapped hashing (optimization)
- Integration tests
- Plugin system

## Test Status

```
Total: 332 tests
Passing: 332 (100%)
Target for 1.0.0: 350+
```

## Commits Made

1. Created `~docs/plans/release-1.0.0-plan.md`
2. Updated `~docs/issues/epics.md` with Epic #13

## Files Modified

- `~docs/plans/release-1.0.0-plan.md` (NEW)
- `~docs/issues/epics.md` (Updated)
- `~docs/session-logs/2026-01-22-session-11.md` (NEW)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Add global error handling endpoint
2. Create CHANGELOG.md
3. Update README installation guide

### Short-term (Week 1)
1. Version bump to 1.0.0-rc1
2. End-to-end workflow testing
3. Performance benchmarks

### Medium-term (Weeks 2-4)
1. Create release builds
2. Final documentation review
3. GitHub release workflow
4. 1.0.0 Release

## Notes

The project is in excellent shape for 1.0.0:
- Clean architecture with 0 warnings
- 332 passing tests
- All core ROM scanner features implemented
- Modern web UI with real-time updates
- Feature parity exceeds RomVault/ClrMame Pro in some areas (web UI, real-time, network drives)

Main gap is documentation and release packaging rather than core functionality.

## Session Statistics

- Documents created: 2
- Issues added: 16
- Blockers identified: 3
- Features analyzed: 40+
