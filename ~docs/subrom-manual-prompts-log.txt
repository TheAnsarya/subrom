build a complete RomVault or ClrMame type ROM file checker, turn on github issues and then make a bunch of issues and todolists for the update process and chat/session logs, and plans and roadmaps and create a UI to  navigate the dat files, and having the roms and downloading them and also collecting the files, from TOSEC, from GOODsets, from NoIntro, etc etc, make utilities to or a service to collect all the dats, then to process the dats, then to scan and organize the  files, then idon't drop  files just because the harddrive went offline; continue; document everything, plan everything, associate everything with guithub issues, and ever issue should be linked to an epic, and every commit should be linked to an issue, go!; continue; make plans for the future of the UI, code library, etc; continue;

update everything to the most modern code, and the mowst modern practices, all of the background code to dotnet 10, c#14 most modern versions, and most modern react version and rewrite everything to use the most modern code practices; go! continue; do the "what's next" tasks, add everything to github issues and todolists and updsate them; make sure to update the session/chat logs; continue;

do the "what's next" tasks, making/updating github issues and todo lists; make sure you always update session/chat logs; always format using the editor configs (k&r braces and tabs not spaces); continue;

there are too many errors trying to update the react ui, so, rebuild the `subrom-ui` using `vite` and modern versions of all code and libraries and modern coding and architecture standards; make a plan and update the roadmap and create github issues including epics and make every sub issue an actual subissue linked to its parent; upddate the documentation and session/chat logs, plans, todolists, etc; make sure to use the `editorconfig` so that means k&r braces stykle and always use ***TABS NOT SPACES***; continue;

continue working on this, making sure to update docs and todos and keep to the most modern practices and standards and code; continue;

continue working on this after git commiting all files, in logical batches connecting them to issues; make sure the plan and components understand some dat files have tens of thousands of entries, some have a couple, and dats are in a heirarchy of dats, and files range from a handful of kilobytes to several gigabytes so the UI needs to be able to handle large data sets and stream the data in batches, not all at once, data cache stuff, and expiring parts and removing them so we don't max out the ram (example reference dats are available at `C:\~reference-roms\dats\`), make plans and todolists and issues and tests; continue, starting with signal R;

No! never use npm! we're based on vite, and if not that then yarn, never npm or npx! add that to the copilot instructions and documentation, then go back and fix all of the npm stuff to use vite/yarn instead; and then continue current work;

continue working on this after git commiting all files, in logical batches connecting them to issues; the backend was created a while ago by hand so it's way out of date, just like you rebuilt the frontend, rebuild the backend from the ground up using modern coding standards and practices and the most recent dotnet version (10?) and c# (14?) and modern build and architecture; can sqlite handle the load or do we need a real db?; understand the goal is a system like Plex where there is a local server component service and a web frontend accessible by url or a menu option on the system tray icon, make issues and todolists and plans and documentation for that too; continue;

do the "next steps" using modern coding standards and practices; update all chat/session logs and todolists and github issues and documentation, docs, documentation!; continue;

make a `nointro` download script `https://no-intro.org/` to get all of the dats to use for reference, download to `C:\~reference-roms\dats\nointro\` for all systems, and implement it and run it; use these new dats as reference and tests; create test projects and a bunch of tests for the backend and frontend, update issues and lists and docs; fix all the warnings; continue; make a service to collect all the rom dats it can find: mame, mess, tosec, goodtools, nointro, redump, and list all the the rom/iso dats available you know about, and sync and download those dats on a schedule, make plans and todolists, and issues and documents; continue;

website is at `https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download&s=64`? dat is at? `https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download&op=dat&s=17`;use those locations and references to download nointro; continue;

the `https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=manager&s=17&download=751` page has a `Download!` link button and you can get nointro dats from there, use that in the the script and service; continue;

we are banned from nointro for trying to scrape it; shelve all that work (the nointro stuff) and work on the other dat sources; and continue all the other work; continue;

the compression/sevenzip project stuff is causing issues, analyze how it's used and why something like it would be need then overhaul is, toss out othe old code and build new compression stuff; make plans, issues, todo lists, etc; actually review all legacy code and modernize the code and architecture; continue;

This is big picture analysis work, so use claude opus instead of claude sonnet;

Make sure there is a directive that we DO NOT scrape the no-intro website as we were insta-banned we we tried it, we'll need another method to get the no-into dats; continue working through the issues;

continue working, but make sure epics and issues are pushed to github issues;

continue; keep updating and creating plans, github issues, epics, todolists, documentation, chat/session logs; work a bunch of issues, updating everything; continue;

Epic #4 did have it's issues create (#70-#79) according to you, make those issues, update them and then close them if done. Check all the other epics and create/update any sub-issues they have, not just in our documentation but in github issues itself; continue;

update chat/session logs, implement `Epic #10: System Tray` and `Epic #8: Large Dataset`; continue;

`large dataset handling` isn't just about dat loading, but more about dataset display and scanning files in large datasets, add issues and plans for that; continue working on the backlog; continue;

continue working, focus on the base code and don't implement many advanced features until the entire base implementation is done; make analysis and plans and todolists and github issues and chat/session logs and documentation and make sure all behaviors we need for a rom scanner are complete; continue;

continue working, focus on the base code; continue;

continue working, focus on the base code; continue; work towards a 1.0.0 release, make a plan for that; create analysis and plans and todolists and github issues and chat/session logs and documentation; continue;

Prepare for the 1.0.0-rc1 release updating the todolists and issues and epics and documentation and readmes and create a full manual testing documention; continue;

create the release for github and then prepare for the release plan and then plan future improvements, like spreading the parallel processing to be accross drives  to spread to read/write load out, etc, that kind of performance and usabillity stuff, nothing outlandish (some of the current "advanced planned features" are like, what? why? what?); continue;

Oh, the c# background services (like scanning files, processing) and webhosting and whole architecture of a "windows service" and the tray icon for accessing the service through a web ui and stuff , do those only work on windows? we want them to work on macd and linux or whatever; explain what is up then make plans and issues and stuff, we want this in the 1.0.0 release with parity for platform agnostic behavior, run anywhere; continue;

The stuff we just planned? implement it! Make the 1.0.0 release, then do the service and tray changes for cross-platform and implement and document them, and when done plan for the 1.1.0 release and then do the 1.1.0 release; continue;

for this release we want to make sure there is full cross platform support so we want an installer (like msi but cross-platform, or if we have to, an installer that works on each platform) that builds everything, sets up the services and the tray icon, and creates shortcuts, etc, make plans and todolists and issues and epics and documentation; then implement it; continue this and previous work, towards a release; continue;
