build a complete RomVault or ClrMame type ROM file checker, turn on github issues and then make a bunch of issues and todolists for the update process and chat/session logs, and plans and roadmaps and create a UI to  navigate the dat files, and having the roms and downloading them and also collecting the files, from TOSEC, from GOODsets, from NoIntro, etc etc, make utilities to or a service to collect all the dats, then to process the dats, then to scan and organize the  files, then idon't drop  files just because the harddrive went offline; continue; document everything, plan everything, associate everything with guithub issues, and ever issue should be linked to an epic, and every commit should be linked to an issue, go!; continue; make plans for the future of the UI, code library, etc; continue;

update everything to the most modern code, and the mowst modern practices, all of the background code to dotnet 10, c#14 most modern versions, and most modern react version and rewrite everything to use the most modern code practices; go! continue; do the "what's next" tasks, add everything to github issues and todolists and updsate them; make sure to update the session/chat logs; continue;

do the "what's next" tasks, making/updating github issues and todo lists; make sure you always update session/chat logs; always format using the editor configs (k&r braces and tabs not spaces); continue;

there are too many errors trying to update the react ui, so, rebuild the `subrom-ui` using `vite` and modern versions of all code and libraries and modern coding and architecture standards; make a plan and update the roadmap and create github issues including epics and make every sub issue an actual subissue linked to its parent; upddate the documentation and session/chat logs, plans, todolists, etc; make sure to use the `editorconfig` so that means k&r braces stykle and always use ***TABS NOT SPACES***; continue;

continue working on this, making sure to update docs and todos and keep to the most modern practices and standards and code; continue;

continue working on this after git commiting all files, in logical batches connecting them to issues; make sure the plan and components understand some dat files have tens of thousands of entries, some have a couple, and dats are in a heirarchy of dats, and files range from a handful of kilobytes to several gigabytes so the UI needs to be able to handle large data sets and stream the data in batches, not all at once, data cache stuff, and expiring parts and removing them so we don't max out the ram (example reference dats are available at `C:\~reference-roms\dats\`), make plans and todolists and issues and tests; continue, starting with signal R;

No! never use npm! we're based on vite, and if not that then yarn, never npm or npx! add that to the copilot instructions and documentation, then go back and fix all of the npm stuff to use vite/yarn instead; and then continue current work;

continue working on this after git commiting all files, in logical batches connecting them to issues; the backend was created a while ago by hand so it's way out of date, just like you rebuilt the frontend, rebuild the backend from the ground up using modern coding standards and practices and the most recent dotnet version (10?) and c# (14?) and modern build and architecture; can sqlite handle the load or do we need a real db?; understand the goal is a system like Plex where there is a local server component service and a web frontend accessible by url or a menu option on the system tray icon, make issues and todolists and plans and documentation for that too; continue;

do the "next steps" using modern coding standards and practices; update all chat/session logs and todolists and github issues and documentation, docs, documentation!; continue;

make a `nointro` download script `https://no-intro.org/` to get all of the dats to use for reference, download to `C:\~reference-roms\dats\nointro\` for all systems, and implement it and run it; use these new dats as reference and tests; create test projects and a bunch of tests for the backend and frontend, update issues and lists and docs; fix all the warnings; continue; make a service to collect all the rom dats it can find: mame, mess, tosec, goodtools, nointro, redump, and list all the the rom/iso dats available you know about, and sync and download those dats on a schedule, make plans and todolists, and issues and documents; continue;
